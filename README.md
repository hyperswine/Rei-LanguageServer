# Rei Language Server

An open source language server extension for VSCode.

RN I just copied rust syntax highlighter enhanced from [here](https://github.com/dustypomerleau/rust-syntax/blob/master/syntaxes/rust.tmLanguage.json).

## Features

- Syntax Highlighting (really only this rn)
- Printing vars and statements that have a definite result, would be introduced in `rein` too
- Automatic type inference and labelling when you dont specify a type

## Requirements

No dependencies right now.
